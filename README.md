# Sorry!

Sorry! is a Python application which replicates the classic board game Sorry. Two modes are available: local multiplayer and online multiplayer. Local multiplayer is self-contained while online multiplayer uses a client-server structure. Basic rules are implemented although a basic understanding of the rules of Sorry is required. Sorry is built with Python 3.9 and PyGame 2.0.

## Client

Using the `Sorry` app in the macOS folder or the `Play Sorry!` executable in the Windows folder is the easiest way to play. 

Alternatively, run `/src/sorry.py` in a Python 3 environment with PyGame installed.

The client has been tested on macOS 11.1 (Big Sur) and Windows 10 (version 2009)

## Server

Both a macOS executable and Windows batch file called `Start Sorry Server` is provided. The executables simply run `python3 src/sorry_server.py`. PyGame is not required for the server.
